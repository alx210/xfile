PREREQUISITES
-------------

Development libraries and headers:

libX11 (including libXinerama, libXt, libXpm)
libXm (Motif 2.3 or newer)

Tools:

C99 compliant C compiler, SysVR4 compatible make, awk and sed

BUILDING AND INSTALLING
-----------------------

If necessary, tweak the target platform specific makefile, Makefile.$(uname),
in the mf sub-directory, e.g. to change installation prefix and whether to 
enable Xft fonts. If no target specific Makefile exists, try "generic".

Run make in the top-level directory.
When build process finishes, run "make install" as root.

INSTALLATION NOTES
------------------

File Types
----------
XFile includes file type definitions for common file types. The default database
file is installed in PREFIX/share/xfile/types. XFile will also look for type
definitions (files with .db suffix) in $HOME/.xfile/types. The database format
is plain text, typical Unix "RC" syntax. See xfile(1) manual and the included
database file for syntax description and examples.

The default database makes use of several predefined variables: terminal,
textEditor, webBrowser, imageViewer, imageEditor, audioPlayer, videoPlayer.
These  may  be set in user's .Xresources (see xfile(1) FILE TYPE DATABASE
section on variable expansion) to accommodate the environment, without
modifying the database (e.g. XFile.variable.terminal: xterm -e).

Fonts
-----
XFile uses different fonts to highlight properties of certain files and
menu elements, appropriate renditions are predefined in the included
app-defaults file. In case of inappropriate font type or size, following
renditions need to be overridden in .Xresources:

variable:   Default variable width font (used to render most GUI elements)
fixed:      Fixed width font
directory:  Directory labels (variable is used by default)
regular:    Regular file labels (variable is used by default)
symlink:    Symbolic links (italic is used by default)
special:    Special files (pipes, devices, etc.) (bold is used by default)

All of the renditions above are defined with Helvetica or Liberation fonts,
depending on whether Xft specific app-defaults is installed.
