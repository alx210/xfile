.SH USER INTERFACE
.SS Directory View
By default, icon size is deduced from label font height. This can be controlled
with the iconSize resource.
Custom icons may be installed in .xfile/icons user's home sub-directory
(see also the FILES section).
If an icon specified in the
type database cannot be found, a built-in, generic icon will be used instead.
.PP
Typing into the directory view will incrementally select the next matching
file name. Incremental search will be reset after a few seconds, or when
the key bound to osfCancel is pressed (see the FileList widget
\fBlookupTimeout\fP resource).
.SS Mount Points
For directories, which are mount points un/mount action will be displayed in the
context menu. Depending on system configuration, alternate un/mount command may
be specified (see mountCommand, unmountCommand), or disabled (see userMounts).
.PP
XFile may be configured to utilize a user mount daemon that manages a "media"
directory (see mediaDirectory, mediaMountCommand, mediaUnmountCommand X
resources).
.SS File/Context Menu
Actions defined in the file type database appear first in File/Context menus,
in the order they were defined. First action in the list is the default -
that is, it's being run whenever an item in the list is activated.
.SS Tools Menu
User defined commands may be added to the \fBTools\fP drop-down menu using
following X resource:
.PP
XFile.tools.<tool name>: <command>
.PP
The command string may contain following context dependent variables:
.PP
.nf
.ta .5i
%n	Selected file name(s).
%p	Current directory (CWD).
%u	User specified parameters (an input dialog will be shown).
.fi
.PP
Environment variables may also be specified using \fBsh\fP syntax.
.PP
To set standard Motif resources, such as label string, mnemonic and
accelerators, menu item widgets in the Tools menu may be referred to as
XFile.mainMenu.toolsMenu.\fI<tool name>\fP.
.SS Pasting Selections
The primary X selection is utilized for file transfer. When one or more
files are selected in an XFile window, these may be pasted in another with
the \fBEdit > Copy Here\fP and \fBEdit > Move Here\fP menu commands.
.PP
XFile owned selection may also be pasted as a list of space separated
file names in an application/widget that requests plain\-text data, such
as terminal or text editor.
